# twiGPS package in R 
## Time-Weighted spatial averaging methods Integrated with GPS measured environmental exposure
Package implements functions calculating four TWSA methods - Point Overlay (PO), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), Density Ranking (DR) and Line Segment (LS)
The fifth function - exposure_stats() - calculates various statistics for TWSA method SpatRasters
Sample data in package:
GPS data - geolife_sandiego (sample data from Geolife GPS Trajectories 1.3 Data for San Diego county) <br />
Environmental data - landsat_ndvi (NDVI calculated from Landsat 9 image for San Diego county captured on 22nd Februrary 2024)
